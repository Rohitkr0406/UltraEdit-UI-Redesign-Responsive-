# UltraEdit UI Redesign (Responsive)

## Project Overview
This project is a responsive redesign of the [UltraEdit download page](https://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/ultraedit-download-thank-you/) created as a learning exercise. It replicates and enhances the original page's UI using only HTML and CSS, focusing on intrinsic responsiveness without media queries. Improvements include advanced hover effects, a card-based layout, a newsletter signup form, and a modern footer.

## Features
- **Intrinsic Responsiveness**: Adapts across devices using CSS flexbox, grid, and `minmax`, without media queries.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Hover effects and animations with CSS custom properties and cubic-bezier timing.
- **Card-Based Layout**: Language download options in a clean, grid-based card layout.
- **Newsletter Signup Form**: Interactive form with styled inputs and buttons.
- **Modern Footer**: Multi-column footer with sitemap and social links.
- **Custom Styling**: Uses CSS custom properties for consistent theming.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure.
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, grid, transitions, and custom properties for responsive design.
